    <p>
      I have many years of experience as a founder or employee of various
      startups. To answer the needs of different startups I had to learn various
      types of programming skills. for example, I learned Android programming
      for Ninisu, Reactjs for Dehgardi, and Solidity for Bloock.
      <br />
      Although in recent years I have focused on working on Reactjs, the
      environment I described above has enabled me to learn different languages
      and frameworks quickly.
      <br />
      The most important meaning of my life in recent years has been
      contributing to open source culture specially Blockchain and
      decentralization. That's why I've written a variety of articles and held
      some educational events in this area and tried to run startups based on
      Ethereum, Steem, Blockstack in Iran. But I had to abandon all of these
      projects due to deterrent laws in Iran and investors' hesitation to invest
      in blockchain-based startups.
      <br />
      Nowadays, this fact is clear to me, if I want to contribute to this
      movement I should have left my country to work in companies operating in
      blockchain field.
      <br />
      I can make you sure, if I get the opportunity to work in such a company, I
      will greatly appreciate this opportunity.
